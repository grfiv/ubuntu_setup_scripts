#Setup Ubuntu programs

A work in progress: 

[```TEST_MENU.sh```](https://github.com/grfiv/ubuntu_setup_scripts/blob/master/TEST_MENU.sh) reads the other ```*.sh``` files in this folder and creates a menu of them

Each of the ```*.sh``` files installs some package or set of packages; or contains instructions to follow

To be used in conjunction with the [dotfiles](http://github.com/grfiv/dotfiles) repo.
